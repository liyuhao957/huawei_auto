scrcpy (v3.1)
scrcpy

pronounced "screen copy"

This application mirrors Android devices (video and audio) connected via USB or TCP/IP and allows control using the computer's keyboard and mouse. It does not require root access or an app installed on the device. It works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

It focuses on:

lightness: native, displays only the device screen
performance: 30~120fps, depending on the device
quality: 1920×1080 or above
low latency: 35~70ms
low startup time: ~1 second to display the first image
non-intrusiveness: nothing is left installed on the Android device
user benefits: no account, no ads, no internet required
freedom: free and open source software
Its features include:

audio forwarding (Android 11+)
recording
virtual display
mirroring with Android device screen off
copy-paste in both directions
configurable quality
camera mirroring (Android 12+)
mirroring as a webcam (V4L2) (Linux-only)
physical keyboard and mouse simulation (HID)
gamepad support
OTG mode
and more…
Prerequisites
The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Audio forwarding is supported for API >= 30 (Android 11+).

Make sure you enabled USB debugging on your device(s).

On some devices (especially Xiaomi), you might get the following error:

java.lang.SecurityException: Injecting input events requires the caller (or the source of the instrumentation, if any) to have the INJECT_EVENTS permission.
In that case, you need to enable an additional option USB debugging (Security Settings) (this is an item different from USB debugging) to control it using a keyboard and mouse. Rebooting the device is necessary once this option is set.

Note that USB debugging is not required to run scrcpy in OTG mode.

Usage examples
There are a lot of options, documented in separate pages. Here are just some common examples.

Capture the screen in H.265 (better quality), limit the size to 1920, limit the frame rate to 60fps, disable audio, and control the device by simulating a physical keyboard:

scrcpy --video-codec=h265 --max-size=1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio --keyboard=uhid
scrcpy --video-codec=h265 -m1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio -K  # short version
Start VLC in a new virtual display (separate from the device display):

scrcpy --new-display=1920x1080 --start-app=org.videolan.vlc
Record the device camera in H.265 at 1920x1080 (and microphone) to an MP4 file:

scrcpy --video-source=camera --video-codec=h265 --camera-size=1920x1080 --record=file.mp4
Capture the device front camera and expose it as a webcam on the computer (on Linux):

scrcpy --video-source=camera --camera-size=1920x1080 --camera-facing=front --v4l2-sink=/dev/video2 --no-playback
Control the device without mirroring by simulating a physical keyboard and mouse (USB debugging not required):

scrcpy --otg
Control the device using gamepad controllers plugged into the computer:

scrcpy --gamepad=uhid
scrcpy -G  # short version
